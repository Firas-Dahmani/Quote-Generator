<h1> Quote Generator </h1>


## What is it?

  Once loaded, it will show a random quote!
  You can then either click "New Quote" and it will pick from any of the 1643's of quotes pulled from an API or you can "tweet" that quote!

## How does it work?

  ### Restful API
  - Sends a get request to a RESTful API to get over 1643 quotes.
  ### Twitter
  - If the user is log in you can tweet your quote without having to copy and paste it.
  ### New Quote Generator
  - Allows the user to refresh the quote from a plethora of different quotes stored locally.
  - If the API is down it will use a handful of quotes from the local storage.
